    "> At the end of this lecture, students will be able to:\n",
    "> * **Formulate dual linear programming problems:** Students will learn to systematically transform primal linear programming problems into their dual formulations for both maximization and minimization forms, understanding how objective coefficients become right-hand sides, constraint matrices are transposed, and inequality directions are inverted.\n",
    "> * **Apply duality theory fundamentals:** Students will understand and apply weak duality (primal objective ≤ dual objective for feasible solutions) and strong duality (optimal values are equal when both problems are feasible), including the concept of duality gaps and their implications for optimization.  \n",
    "> * **Interpret dual solutions economically:** Students will learn to interpret dual variables as shadow prices that represent the marginal value of resources, understand their role in sensitivity analysis, and recognize how dual solutions provide certificates of primal optimality and computational alternatives.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lecture, we explored the fundamental concepts of dual linear programming and the powerful theoretical relationships between primal and dual problems. We learned how to systematically construct dual formulations and understand their economic significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key takeaways:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Dual transformation follows systematic rules.** We learned the mechanical process of converting primal problems to dual problems: objective coefficients become right-hand sides, constraint matrices are transposed, inequality directions flip, and the optimization sense reverses (max↔min). These transformations work consistently for both maximization and minimization primal forms.\n",
    "> * **Duality theory provides powerful bounds and certificates.** Weak duality guarantees that any primal feasible solution provides a lower bound for any dual feasible solution (for maximization problems), while strong duality ensures that optimal values are equal when both problems are feasible, giving us the fundamental result that solving either problem solves both.\n",
    "> * **Dual variables have economic interpretation as shadow prices.** The dual variables represent the marginal value of relaxing constraints by one unit, providing insights for sensitivity analysis and resource valuation. This interpretation makes dual problems valuable for understanding the economic structure of optimization problems beyond just finding optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where do we go from here?** The systematic dual transformation rules and duality theory we learned provide the foundation for understanding the economic meaning of optimization problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the upcoming lab, we'll see how dual variables can be interpreted as shadow prices in practical applications like Flux Balance Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding both primal and dual formulations gives you multiple perspectives on the same optimization problem and prepares you for more advanced topics in linear programming!\n",
