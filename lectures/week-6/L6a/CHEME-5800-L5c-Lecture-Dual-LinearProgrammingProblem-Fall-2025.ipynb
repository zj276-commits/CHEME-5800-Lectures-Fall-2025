    "# L6a: Introduction to the Dual Problem in Linear Programming\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll introduce the core concepts of linear programming and apply these concepts to a classic class of problems: resource allocation challenges such as production planning, consumer choice, and network flow.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> By the end of this lecture, you will be able to define and demonstrate mastery of the following key concepts:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * __Primal Linear Programming Problem__: In the _primal problem_, we directly choose how much of an activity (e.g., production levels) to do to optimize a cost, profit, or satisfaction while respecting resource limits. Primal problems can be maximization or minimization problems.\n",
    "> * __Dual Linear Programming  Problem__: In the _dual problem_, you instead assign a _shadow price_ to each resource constraint—choosing those prices so that, if every activity were valued at its resource cost, the total value of your resources is maximized or minimized. If the primal is a maximization problem, the dual is a minimization problem, and vice versa.\n",
    "> * __Advanced: Lagrange Multipliers and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) Conditions__: The KKT conditions for a linear program say, intuitively, that at the optimum you must satisfy all your original constraints, assign _shadow prices_ that respect the cost structure, and have any slack in a constraint paired with a zero price (and vice versa). We care about these because they give a foolproof certificate of optimality and directly drive the pivot rules in simplex and the search directions in interior-point methods.\n",

    "### What has changed?\n",
    "There are several key differences between the primal and dual linear programming problems:\n",
    "1. The objective function flips (maximum ⇒ minimum or minimum ⇒ maximum).\n",
    "2. Primal objective coefficients $c_i$ become the dual right-hand side constants.\n",
    "3. Primal right-hand side constants $b_j$ become the dual objective coefficients.\n",
    "4. The $m\\times n$ constraint matrix $A$ is transposed in the dual (so $A^\\top$ appears).\n",
    "5. The number of variables and constraints swap: the primal has $n$ variables, $m$ constraints, and the dual has $m$ variables and $n$ constraints.\n",
    "6. Each primal constraint $a_j^\\top x \\le b_j$ gives a dual variable $y_j$. Each primal variable $x_i$ gives a dual constraint $(A^\\top y)_i \\ge c_i$.\n",
    "7. Inequality directions and sign restrictions invert for the constraints: A $\\le$ constraint in the primal gives rise to a $\\ge$ constraint in the dual (and vice versa).\n",
    "8. Equality constraints in the primal become free variables in the dual, i.e., $a_j^T x = b_j$ gives rise to a dual variable $y_j$ that is free (no sign restriction), while a dual constraint $A^\\top y \\ge c$ gives rise to a primal variable $x_i$ that is free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the solutions of the primal and dual problems are related by the concept of __duality__. For a primal problem: $\\max\\{\\,c^T x : A x \\le b,\\;x\\ge0\\}$ and its corresponding dual problem: $\\min\\{\\,b^T y : A^T y \\ge c,\\;y\\ge0\\}$, the solutions are related:\n",
    "* __Weak duality__: For any primal feasible $x$ and dual feasible $y$, we have $c^T x \\le b^T y$. Thus, the primal optimum is always bounded above by the dual optimum. The difference between the two is called the _duality gap_.\n",
    "* __Strong duality__: If both primal and dual are feasible and have finite optimal values, then $\\max\\{\\,c^T x \\} = \\min\\{\\,b^T y\\}$, i.e., the _duality gap is zero_. This means that the optimal values of the primal and dual problems are equal.\n",
