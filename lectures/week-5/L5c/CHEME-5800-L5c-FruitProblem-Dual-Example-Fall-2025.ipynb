    "> * **Linear optimization with budget constraints produces corner solutions** - you'll typically buy all of one item or all of another, with the choice determined by which fruit gives higher marginal utility per dollar spent.\n",
    "> * **Economic intuition aligns with mathematical results** - the slopes of budget lines and indifference curves predict the solution, and the special case of equal ratios leads to multiple optimal solutions.\n",
    "> * **Julia's optimization ecosystem makes implementation straightforward** - proper problem setup with bounds, error handling, and solution interpretation are the key skills, not the computational mechanics.\n",
