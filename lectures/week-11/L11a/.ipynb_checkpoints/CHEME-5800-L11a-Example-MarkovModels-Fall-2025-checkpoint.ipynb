    "> After completing this activity, students will be able to:\n",
    "> * **Construct and validate transition matrices:** Build a three-state Markov chain transition matrix and verify that it satisfies the row-stochastic property, where each row sums to one and represents valid transition probabilities.\n",
    "> * **Compute stationary distributions through iteration:** Implement iterative methods to compute the stationary distribution π by raising the transition matrix to successive powers until convergence and verify the rank-one property of the resulting matrix.\n",
    "> * **Simulate Markov chain dynamics and validate convergence:** Generate state sequences by sampling from categorical distributions based on transition probabilities and demonstrate that the empirical state frequencies converge to the theoretical stationary distribution as the number of samples increases.\n",

    "> \n",
    "> * **Transition matrix structure and properties:** We constructed a 3×3 transition matrix P satisfying the row-stochastic property and verified that each row sums to one. The full rank of the transition matrix ensures that all states are accessible, which is necessary for the existence of a unique stationary distribution.\n",
    "> * **Stationary distribution convergence:** We computed the stationary distribution π by iteratively raising the transition matrix to successive powers until convergence (when ||P^(k+1) - P^k|| < ε). The resulting matrix converged to rank one, where every row contains identical probability values representing the stationary distribution, confirming the theoretical prediction for non-periodic Markov chains.\n",
    "> * **Simulation validates theoretical predictions:** We generated 10,000-step state sequences by sampling categorical distributions based on transition probabilities and demonstrated that empirical state frequencies converged to the theoretical stationary distribution. Direct sampling from the stationary distribution produced identical frequency distributions but eliminated temporal dynamics, illustrating the trade-off between steady-state and transient behavior analysis.\n",
