    "## Graph Properties and Metrics\n",
    "Understanding the structure and characteristics of graphs requires several fundamental metrics that quantify connectivity patterns and local properties of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertex Degree\n",
    "The __degree__ of a vertex $v_{i}\\in\\mathcal{V}$ in a graph $\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$, denoted $\\deg(v_{i})$, is the number of edges incident to that vertex. For directed graphs, we distinguish between two types of degree:\n",

    "Several mathematical measures characterize the overall structure and connectivity of graphs. These tools apply to any graph type and form the foundation for understanding more complex graph properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Core Graph Measurements**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Degree Distribution**: These describe the range of connectivity across vertices in a graph:\n",
    ">   - __Minimum degree__: $\\delta(\\mathcal{G}) = \\min_{v_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\deg(v_{i})$ - the least connected vertex\n",

    ">\n",
    "> * **Maximum Possible Edges**: For a simple undirected graph with $n$ vertices, the maximum number of edges occurs when every pair of vertices is connected: $|\\mathcal{E}|_{\\text{max}} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. This represents choosing 2 vertices from $n$ vertices, with each pair connected by exactly one edge.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Graph Density**: The density $\\rho(\\mathcal{G})$ measures how \"filled in\" a graph is compared to its maximum possible connectivity: $\\rho(\\mathcal{G}) = \\frac{|\\mathcal{E}|}{|\\mathcal{E}|_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{2|\\mathcal{E}|}{n(n-1)}$. Dense graphs have $\\rho$ close to 1 (lots of connections), while sparse graphs have $\\rho$ close to 0 (few connections relative to what's possible).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Regular Graphs**: A graph is __regular__ of degree $r$ if every vertex has exactly the same degree: $\\deg(v_{i}) = r$ for all $v_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$. Regular graphs have uniform connectivity patterns, making them useful for understanding symmetric network structures where every node has identical connection behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Adjacency list\n",
    "An adjacency list for a graph $\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$ is a $\\dim\\mathcal{V}$ dictionary $d$, where\n",

    "In other words, $d_{i}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{C}_{i}$. There is a single entry in dictionary $d$ for each vertex in graph $\\mathcal{G}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Considerations: When to use which representation?\n",
    "The choice between adjacency matrices and adjacency lists depends on graph characteristics and required operations. Understanding graph density provides the key insight for this decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Graph Density:** The density $\\rho$ of a graph $\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$ measures how \"filled in\" the graph is relative to a complete graph. For undirected graphs: $\\rho = \\frac{|\\mathcal{E}|}{|\\mathcal{V}|(|\\mathcal{V}|-1)/2}$, while directed graphs use $|\\mathcal{V}|(|\\mathcal{V}|-1)$ in the denominator. Dense graphs have $\\rho$ close to 1, while sparse graphs have $\\rho$ close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency matrices always require $O(|\\mathcal{V}|^{2})$ space regardless of edge count, making them efficient for dense graphs where $|\\mathcal{E}| \\approx |\\mathcal{V}|^{2}$.

    "## Complete Graphs: Maximal Connectivity\n",
    "A __complete graph__ $K_{n}$ is a simple undirected graph on $n$ vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by exactly one edge. Complete graphs represent the opposite extreme from trees in the connectivity spectrum, achieving maximal edge density while maintaining the simple graph property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Complete Graphs\n",
    "For a complete graph $K_{n}$ with vertex set $\\mathcal{V} = \\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\}$, we can apply the general mathematical principles from the previous section to derive specific properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "The __edge count__ achieves the theoretical maximum: since every vertex must connect to every other vertex exactly once, we have exactly $|\\mathcal{E}| = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every vertex in a complete graph has the same __degree__, specifically $\\deg(v_{i}) = n-1$ for all $v_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$. This makes complete graphs __regular graphs__ of degree $n-1$, meaning all vertices have identical connectivity patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __graph density__ of complete graphs achieves the theoretical maximum: $\\rho(K_{n}) = 1$. Since every possible edge exists in the graph, complete graphs represent the upper bound for density in simple graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural Properties\n",
    "Complete graphs exhibit several distinctive structural characteristics that distinguish them from other graph types:\n",
    "\n",
    "The __diameter__ of $K_{n}$ equals 1 for $n \\geq 2$, since every pair of vertices is directly connected, making it impossible to have a shortest path longer than one edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __clique number__ $\\omega(K_{n}) = n$ because the entire vertex set forms a single large clique. Similarly, the __chromatic number__ $\\chi(K_{n}) = n$, as each vertex must receive a distinct color since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. Finally, the __independence number__ $\\alpha(K_{n}) = 1$, reflecting that no two vertices are non-adjacent, so the largest independent set contains only a single vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications and Theoretical Significance\n",

    "Complete graphs appear frequently in both practical applications and theoretical studies because they represent the \"worst-case\" or \"most connected\" scenario in many contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Real-World Applications and Mathematical Importance**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Network Design and Communication**: Complete graphs model scenarios where every node must communicate directly with every other node, such as conference calls where everyone can speak to everyone else, or distributed computing systems requiring full connectivity. In these cases, $K_{n}$ represents the ideal but often impractical solution due to cost and complexity.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Tournament and Competition Modeling**: In round-robin tournaments where every team plays every other team exactly once, the structure forms a complete graph. Each vertex represents a team, and each edge represents a game between two teams. This makes complete graphs natural for analyzing competitive scenarios.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Algorithm Testing and Complexity Analysis**: Complete graphs serve as important test cases for graph algorithms because they represent the most challenging input - maximum edge density means algorithms must process the largest possible number of connections. Many algorithms achieve their worst-case running time on complete graphs.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Mathematical Optimization Problems**: Complete graphs appear as building blocks in many optimization problems. For example, the famous Traveling Salesman Problem often considers complete graphs where finding the shortest route visiting all cities becomes computationally challenging as the number of vertices grows.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Graph Theory Foundations**: Complete graphs provide reference points for understanding other graph types. They help establish upper bounds for graph properties and serve as comparison baselines - if a property holds for complete graphs, it often provides insight into general graph behavior.\n",

    "Trees represent the minimal connected structure within the hierarchy of graphs (they use the fewest possible edges to keep all vertices connected). As __subgraphs__, every tree is a special case of a connected graph. More broadly, every connected graph $\\mathcal{G}$ contains at least one __spanning tree__ $\\mathcal{T}$ where $\\mathcal{V}(\\mathcal{T}) = \\mathcal{V}(\\mathcal{G})$ and $\\mathcal{E}(\\mathcal{T}) \\subseteq \\mathcal{E}(\\mathcal{G})$. \n",
