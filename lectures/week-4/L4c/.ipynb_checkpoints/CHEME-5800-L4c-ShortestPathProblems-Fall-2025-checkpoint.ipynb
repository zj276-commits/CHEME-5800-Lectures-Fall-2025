    "## Motivation\n",
    "Before we dive into the algorithms, let's explore what a shortest-path problem is and why it's important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortest-path problems enable us to find the most efficient route between two points in a graph, such as minimizing travel time on a roadmap, signal delay in a communication network, cost in a logistics system, or the fewest number of unit operations in a chemical process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, but what exactly is a shortest-path problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Shortest Path Problem**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Consider a weighted graph $\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$ where $\\mathcal{V}$ represents the set of vertices (nodes) and $\\mathcal{E}$ represents the set of edges connecting these vertices. Each edge $(u,v) \\in \\mathcal{E}$ has an associated weight $w(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ that represents the cost of traversing from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A __path__ from source vertex $s \\in \\mathcal{V}$ to target vertex $t \\in \\mathcal{V}$ is defined as a sequence of vertices $P = \\langle v_0, v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k \\rangle$ where $v_0 = s$ is the source, $v_k = t$ is the target, and each consecutive pair $(v_i, v_{i+1}) \\in \\mathcal{E}$ forms a valid edge in the graph for all $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, k-1$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The __weight__ (or cost) of any path $P$ is the sum of all edge weights along that path:\n",
    "> $$w(P) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} w(v_i, v_{i+1})$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Now we can formally state the __shortest path problem__: find a path $P^*$ from source $s$ to target $t$ that minimizes the total path weight. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n",
    "> $$P^* = \\arg\\min_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}_{s,t}} w(P)$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> where $\\mathcal{P}_{s,t}$ denotes the set of all possible paths from $s$ to $t$. The weight $w(P^*)$ is called the __shortest path distance__ from $s$ to $t$, commonly denoted $d(s,t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem Variants:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Depending on what we want to compute, shortest path problems come in several flavors. \n",
    "> * In __single-source shortest paths__, we find shortest paths from one source vertex to all other vertices. \n",
    "> * The __single-destination__ variant finds shortest paths from all vertices to one destination vertex. \n",
    "> * Sometimes we only care about the __single-pair shortest path__ between a specific pair of vertices. \n",
    "> * Finally, __all-pairs shortest paths__ finds shortest paths between every pair of vertices in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mathematical description provides the foundation for understanding why algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford work, and how they systematically explore the graph to guarantee optimal solutions.\n",

    "## Conceptual Approach\n",
    "Before diving into specific algorithms, let's build some intuition about how we approach shortest path problems systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive approach of checking every possible path quickly becomes computationally prohibitive. Even small graphs can have exponentially many paths! However, shortest path problems have a key mathematical property that enables efficient solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Optimal Substructure Property:** If the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ passes through some intermediate vertex $v$, then the portion from $s$ to $v$ must also be a shortest path from $s$ to $v$. If there were a shorter path from $s$ to $v$, we could use it to create an even shorter path from $s$ to $t$, contradicting our assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight suggests we can build shortest paths incrementally, always maintaining the best distance estimates found so far. The algorithms we'll study employ two different strategies to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Greedy Strategy (Dijkstra's approach):__ Always extend the shortest confirmed path next. This works when we can guarantee that once we've found the shortest path to a vertex, we'll never find a better one later. This requires non-negative edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Iterative Relaxation (Bellman-Ford approach):__ Repeatedly improve distance estimates by \"relaxing\" edges until no further improvements are possible. This more conservative approach can handle negative weights but requires more computational work.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why do negative weights complicate things?__ Imagine you've found what appears to be the shortest path to vertex $v$, but later discover a path with negative-weight edges. Suddenly, a \"longer\" path might have lower total cost! This violates the greedy assumption that distances can be finalized incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how these conceptual ideas translate into concrete algorithms.\n",

    "## Dijkstra's Algorithm\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm is a _greedy algorithm_ that finds the shortest path from a source vertex $s$ to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Fun story:__ Edsger Dijkstra, while with his fiancée at a café in Amsterdam in 1956, conceived the shortest path algorithm in approximately 20 minutes (in his head) while drinking some coffee. He described it as a \"twenty-minute invention,\" saying that doing it \"without pencil and paper, you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable complexities\". Keep it simple, right?\n",

If you have negative weights, that assumption is not true, and the algorithm can produce incorrect distances; for example, it may miss a shorter path discovered later.\n",

    "* __Negative Weights & Cycles__: Bellman-Ford handles negative edge weights by performing $|\\mathcal{V}|-1$ rounds of relaxation and then one extra pass to _detect_ any negative-weight cycle. It always terminates in $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{V}|\\cdot|\\mathcal{E}|)$ time. If the extra pass finds a further relaxation, it reports a negative cycle rather than looping forever. When such a cycle exists, the algorithm cannot produce valid shortest-path distances because paths can be made arbitrarily short by repeatedly traversing the negative cycle.\n",
