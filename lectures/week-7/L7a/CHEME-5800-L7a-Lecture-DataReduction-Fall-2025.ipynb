If $\\hat{\\Sigma}_{ij} < 0$, then features $i$ and $j$ are negatively correlated, meaning that as one feature increases, the other feature tends to decrease. If $\\hat{\\Sigma}_{ij} = 0$, then features $i$ and $j$ are uncorrelated, meaning that there is no linear relationship between the two features.\n",
    "* _Symmetry_: The covariance matrix $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}$ is symmetric, meaning that $\\hat{\\Sigma}_{ij} = \\hat{\\Sigma}_{ji}$ for all $i$ and $j$. This is because the covariance between features $i$ and $j$ is the same as the covariance between features $j$ and $i$.\n",

    "### Decomposing the Covariance Matrix\n",
    "Now to the magical part! The (empirical) covariance matrix $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}$ can be decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. But why is this so important? Many reasons, but let's look at a few of the most important ones. Because $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}$ is real, symmetric, and positive semi-definite, its eigenpair $(\\mathbf{v}_i,\\lambda_i)$ have several special and useful properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Orthonormal eigenvectors**: The eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ of the covariance matrix $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}$ are orthonormal, meaning that they are mutually orthogonal and have unit length. This means that $\\mathbf{V}^\\top \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{V}=[\\,\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_m]\\in\\R^{m\\times m}$ is the matrix of eigenvectors. Thus, we can write the covariance matrix in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{V}\\,\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\,\\mathbf{V}^\\top,\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $\\mathbf{V}=[\\,\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_m]\\in\\R^{m\\times m}$ has orthonormal columns ($\\mathbf{V}^\\top \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{I}$), where each $\\mathbf{v}_i$ is an eigenvector of $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-negative eigenvalues**: All eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ of the covariance matrix $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}$ are non-negative, i.e., $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$. This is because the covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. The eigenvalues can be arranged in descending order:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\Lambda=\\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda_1,\\dots,\\lambda_m),\n",
    "   \\quad\n",
    "   \\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq \\lambda_m \\geq 0.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Each $\\lambda_i$ equals the _variance of the data_ along the direction $\\mathbf{v}_i$. That seems to be a very important property, so let's unpack it a bit more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Principal components**: Projecting a centered data vector $\\mathbf{x}$ onto $\\mathbf{v}_i$ gives the i-th principal component:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   y_i \\;=\\; \\mathbf{v}_i^\\top(\\mathbf{x}-\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}),\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   whose variance across the dataset is exactly $\\lambda_i$. Thus, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ represent the amount of variance captured by each principal component $\\mathbf{v}_i$. The first principal component $\\mathbf{v}_1$ captures the most variance, the second principal component $\\mathbf{v}_2$ captures the second most variance, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimal low-rank approximation**\n",
    "   Keeping only the top $k$ eigenvectors (the columns of $\\mathbf{V}_k=[\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_k]$) yields the best $k$-dimensional linear reconstruction of the data in the least-squares sense.  In other words, the subspace spanned by $\\{\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_k\\}$ maximizes retained variance and minimizes reconstruction error. We'll see this in action later in this module!\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties make the covariance matrix eigenpairs $(\\mathbf{v}_i,\\lambda_i)$ the foundation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where eigenvectors provide maximum variance directions and eigenvalues measure captured variance. Now let's explore an alternative approach using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).\n",
